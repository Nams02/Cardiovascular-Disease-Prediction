# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

![Heart](heart_image.png)

## Introduction
Cardiovascular disease, also known as heart disease, is a major global health concern. This project aims to develop an accurate machine-learning model to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease based on various risk factors and attributes. The project description can be found [here](Project_Description.docx).

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a comprehensive set of features related to heart health, collected from real-world patient data. It can be found [here](cardio_train.csv).

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed to run the project:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install any missing dependencies using `pip install library_name`.

## Usage
To run the model and obtain predictions, execute the `predict.py` script after installing the dependencies. Provide the required inputs as prompted, and the model will output the probability of cardiovascular disease presence. The data preprocessing steps and exploratory data analysis can be found in the Jupyter Notebook [here](main.ipynb).

## Model Evaluation
I have compared the performance of various machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). The best-performing model, along with its evaluation metrics, is included in the Jupyter Notebook.
## Results
My final model achieves an accuracy of 73.19% in predicting cardiovascular disease presence. It is essential to note that this model should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice. For a more detailed analysed conclusion report, please refer to the [complete report](Model_Prediction_Conclusion_Report.md).

## Contributing
I welcome contributions to enhance the model's performance or explore additional features. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to Corizo, which provided the dataset used in this project.
